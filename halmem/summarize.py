"""Hal's unattended, self-resuming lecture-note runner (`hal-memory summarize`).

Reads `_Import-Staging/SLIDES-REPORT.md`, then for every deck/paper/exercise that
still needs a note it loads the cached text, asks the LOCAL model (Ollama) to write
a self-contained study note, and files it under
`Areas/Study/<Year>/<Course>/<Title>.md`.

What makes the notes useful (not a transcript, not a shallow blurb):
  * Each note is **self-contained study notes**, a short Summary up top, then the
    slide content *condensed into concise, interpretable notes* you can revise from
    without opening the original deck. The source is LINKED at the bottom, never
    pasted in.
  * Notes are organised **by year -> module -> section**, derived from the file's real
    Canvas path and `Course structure.md` (not the "Linked materials" folder it sat in).
  * Every note carries a breadcrumb that wikilinks the whole spine,
    [[University]] > [[<Year> Index]] > [[<CODE> Index]] > [[<CODE> Index#<Section>]],
    and every reusable concept it mentions is linked inline as [[Topic]], with a matching
    stub auto-created under `Areas/Study/Topics/`. The module index (grouped by section in
    teaching order), the year hub, and the root MOC are rebuilt as it goes, so Obsidian's
    graph wires the whole degree together by wikilinks. The root's name comes from
    [memory].university in the config (HAL_UNIVERSITY overrides it).

Why this is the right tool for hundreds/thousands of files:
  * Each deck is summarised in its OWN fresh model call, the 32K context window
    never fills up, so there's no auto-compaction and no drift.
  * Every finished note is written to disk immediately, and decks that already
    have a note are skipped. So the run is fully RESUMABLE: stop it whenever,
    start it again, and it picks up exactly where it left off.

It talks to you as Hal while it works, and writes itself a short session log at
the end so the job shows up in your second brain.

Usage:
  hal summarize                  # do everything outstanding, unattended (default)
  hal summarize --course NAME     # limit to one course (name, code, or folder)
  hal summarize --interactive     # pause for a nod before each course
  hal summarize --limit N         # only the next N decks (good for a trial run)
  hal summarize --include-maybe   # also revisit rows flagged 'maybe'
  hal summarize --model NAME       # use a different Ollama model
  hal summarize --mock            # wiring test: no model call, placeholder notes

`hal summarize` runs `hal-memory summarize`, which takes the same options. The model is
HAL_MODEL when the hal launcher sets one, else [hal].chat_model; HAL_CHAT_API=openai sends
the calls to the launcher's llama.cpp server instead of Ollama.
