# Hal slash commands

These Claude Code commands ship with hal-memory in `claude-commands/`. `hal-memory setup` links
them into `~/.claude/commands/`, so edits here reach Claude Code without reinstalling.

Every command works in two modes and figures out which one it's in by checking whether the working
directory is inside `$HAL_VAULT`:

- **Vault mode**: memory is `$HAL_VAULT/CLAUDE.md`, session logs go to
  `$HAL_VAULT/Areas/Work/Session-Logs/`.
- **Project mode**: memory is `./CLAUDE.md` if there is one, session logs go to
  `./CC-Session-Logs/`. If the repo has been registered with `hal-memory register-repos`, logs are
  mirrored into the vault as well.

## Memory

### `/load-context [N] [topic]`

Reload context at the start of a session. A leading number sets how many recent session logs to
pull (default 3); anything after it is treated as a topic to search for across the logs and memory.

Loads the right `CLAUDE.md` for the mode, pulls the N most recent logs by filename date, and if a
topic was given, greps the rest for it. Comes back with open tasks, active projects and whatever it
found on the topic, deliberately terse, because anything it loads is context the actual work
doesn't get.

### `/compress`

Save the session before you end it. Asks what's worth keeping, writes a log with the standard
structure, then offers to lift anything durable up into `CLAUDE.md`.

Logs are summary-first, not transcripts. Each one is a Quick Reference block, decisions made,
pending tasks, and optionally a few verbatim snippets. A full transcript would eat the context
window on the next `/load-context`, which defeats the point.

### `/preserve`

Write one durable fact, decision or convention into `CLAUDE.md`. Archives the file automatically
once it passes about 280 lines, so permanent memory can't quietly grow until it fills the context.

---

## Daily

### `/daily-note`

Create or open `Calendar/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with priorities and links.

### `/morning-brief` (`hal brief`)

Build today's morning brief and drop it into today's daily note.

Runs `hal-memory brief`, which assembles open tasks and today's deadlines, yesterday's wins, active
project and last session status, and a "concept of the day" pulled from the topic graph. It writes
a marker-fenced `Morning Brief` block under the daily note's H1, so re-running it refreshes the
block rather than stacking another copy. If the model is unavailable it falls back to a plain,
unsummarised brief. Cron-friendly: a 07:00 entry has it waiting before you sit down.

### `/inbox-process`

Triage `+Inbox/`. For each item, work out what it actually is and file it into the right area, with
frontmatter and links added on the way.

### `/weekly-review`

Summarise the week from the daily notes and session logs: what got done, what stalled, what's
carrying into next week.

## Notes and knowledge

### `/ask` (`hal ask`)

Answer a question using only your own notes, with `[[wikilink]]` citations.

Runs `hal-memory ask`: finds the closest notes by keyword and by meaning (hal-memory's semantic
index), and asks the model to answer *from those passages only*, citing each source note as an
Obsidian wikilink, or saying plainly that the notes don't cover it. The same retrieval is exposed
to MCP clients by hal-hub as `memory_search` and `memory_recall`.

Keyword search needs no index; the idle service keeps the semantic index current, and
`hal-memory index` (`hal index`) updates it now. Flags: `--k N`, `--show-context`, `--no-llm`,
`--answerer local|claude`.

Retrieval runs on-device in every profile. The answer does too, unless `[memory].answerer` is
`claude` (the cloud profile), where Claude Code writes it from the retrieved passages.

### `/meeting-note`

Turn a transcript or a page of scrappy notes into a structured meeting note: YAML frontmatter so
it shows up in Dataview queries, and wikilinks out to the people and topics mentioned.

### `/summarize-slides [course]`

Write lecture notes for the decks (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, HTML) in `SLIDES-REPORT.md` that don't have
one yet. Run `hal-memory import prepare` first to extract their text. For hundreds of decks use
the unattended `hal summarize` (`hal-memory summarize`) instead.

### `/import-vault [name]`

Reclassify a staged old vault into `Areas/`. `hal-memory import stage OLD_VAULT` copies the old
vault into staging and writes an `IMPORT-MANIFEST.md`; the command reads the manifest, proposes a destination for each
folder, and rewrites the notes with consistent frontmatter as it moves them.

### `/index-repos [repo]`

Flesh out the hub notes under `Areas/Code/`. Summarises each registered repo from its README, sets
up per-repo memory, and wires session-log mirroring.

Reads git metadata and README text only. It does not copy source into the vault, and it skips
`.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, credentials and anything matching `secrets*`.

## Obsidian integration

Live vault access goes through the **Local REST API** plugin, over `https://127.0.0.1:27124` with
the plugin's own certificate. That gives search, read, append and patch against the *running*
Obsidian instance, so notes update in front of you rather than on next reload. It only works while
Obsidian is open; everything else in Hal reads the vault straight off disk and doesn't care.

## Vault layout

```
Vault/
|-- +Inbox/       quick capture, emptied by /inbox-process
|-- Areas/        Work, Study, Personal, Health
|-- Calendar/     Daily, Weekly, Monthly
|-- System/       templates, dashboards, the profile note
`-- CLAUDE.md     permanent memory
```
