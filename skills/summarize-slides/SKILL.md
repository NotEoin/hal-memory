# summarize-slides -- Summarise lecture slides into notes

Fill the gaps: for every slide deck that has **no summary note yet**, create a structured
lecture note from its extracted text. Decks that already have a summary are left alone.
Works for any extracted file type -- PDF, DOCX, PPTX, HTML.

**Prerequisite:** run `hal-memory import prepare` first (it runs every extractor -- PDF, DOCX, PPTX,
HTML -- caches the text and writes a combined `SLIDES-REPORT.md`). This command reads that --
it does **not** re-read the source files directly, which keeps it fast and works for the
text-only local model. (`hal-memory import extract pdf|docx|pptx|html` runs a single extractor
if you only have one type.)

> **Big batch? Prefer `hal summarize`.** This interactive command is best for a handful of
> decks or a single course you want to watch. For hundreds/thousands of files, the unattended
> runner `hal summarize` (`hal-memory summarize`) is the better tool: it summarises one deck
> per fresh model call so the 32K window never fills, writes each note as it goes, and resumes
> itself -- no manual restarts. Both write the same note shape and skip the same already-done
> decks, so they're interchangeable and safe to mix.

## Step 0 -- Load the report
Read `$HAL_VAULT/_Import-Staging/SLIDES-REPORT.md`. The work queue = rows marked
**none**. (Optionally also `maybe` if the user wants those reviewed.) If the user
names a course, filter to that course only. If the report is missing, tell the user to run
`hal-memory import prepare` and stop.

## Step 1 -- Plan + confirm
Group the gap decks by course and show counts (e.g. "Algorithms: 11 decks, Databases: 7...").
Warn that summarising many decks on a local model takes time, and propose doing it
**course by course**. Get a go-ahead and an optional starting course.

## Step 2 -- For each gap deck (batched per course)
1. **Skip if already done** (resumable): if any note in `Areas/Study/` has frontmatter
   `source_file:` equal to this deck, skip it. This makes re-runs safe.
2. Read the cached text from the path in the row's **Cache** column (it points at the right
   per-type cache, e.g. `_Import-Staging/.pdf-text/...` or `.docx-text/...`, `.pptx-text/...`,
   `.html-text/...`).
   - If the text is **very long** (won't fit comfortably in context), summarise in chunks
     (e.g. ~10-page blocks), then synthesise the chunk summaries into one note. Don't dump
     raw slide text into the note.
   - If status was `needs-OCR`/`empty`, skip and add it to a "couldn't read" list (suggest
     re-running `hal-memory import prepare --ocr`).
3. **Work out year / module / section from the file's real path** -- `canvas_downloads/<year>/
   <Module - CODE>/...`, ignoring the `Linked materials` / `Pages` wrapper. Read the module's
   `Course structure.md` and match this deck (by its `[File]`/`[Page]` reference) to its
   **section/week**. Unmatched decks are still filed by year/module, just under "unsorted".
4. **Write the note** to `$HAL_VAULT/Areas/Study/<Year>/<Module>/<Deck Title>.md` using the
   `System/Templates/Lecture.md` shape. Frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   type: lecture            # or note/exercise/solution/exam by role
   date: <source file mtime, via: stat -c %y "<file>">
   year: <Year>
   course: <Module name>
   code: <module code>
   section: <Canvas section/week, or empty>
   role: <lecture|exercise|solution|exam|handout>
   source_file: <in-vault path to the copied deck>
   status: active
   tags: [study, <code>, <role>]
   ```
   First body line is the breadcrumb: `*[[<$HAL_UNIVERSITY>]] > [[<Year> Index|<Year>]] >
   [[<CODE> Index|<Module>]] > [[<CODE> Index#<Section>|<Section>]] - <role>*`. Then
   **Summary** (2-4 sentences), **Notes** (the substance, condensed into your own words),
   **Key terms & formulas**, **Takeaways**, **Follow-ups** as `- [ ]`. A genuinely useful
   summary, not a slide-by-slide transcript.
5. **Link inline + make stubs.** Wrap each genuine reusable concept in `[[wikilinks]]` the
   first time it appears, and create a stub for any new concept in `Areas/Study/Topics/` so the
   link resolves and Obsidian's backlinks surface every place it's taught.
6. **Keep the source with the note:** copy the deck (whatever its extension) into
   `Areas/Study/<Year>/<Module>/Slides/` and **link** it at the bottom (`[[<deck>]]`) -- never
   paste raw slide text into the note. `source_file` points to its new in-vault location.
7. After each course: rebuild that module's `<CODE> Index.md` (notes grouped by section in
   teaching order) plus the `<Year> Index` and institution-root hubs, report how many
   notes were created, and pause for a quick check.

## Step 3 -- Existing summaries
For `maybe` decks (a note mentions the file but it's unclear if it's a real summary): show
the candidate note and ask whether to (a) leave it, (b) enrich it with frontmatter +
`source_file`, or (c) regenerate. Never overwrite the user's own notes without confirmation.

## Step 4 -- Wrap up
- Refresh `Areas/Study/_Index.md` is automatic (Dataview).
- Note the work in `$HAL_VAULT/CLAUDE.md` (courses + deck counts summarised).
- Report: notes created per course, decks skipped (already done), and any that couldn't be
  read (need OCR). Remind the user the staging copy stays until they confirm cleanup.
