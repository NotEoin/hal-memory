# import-vault -- Reclassify an imported vault

Turn a raw staged copy of an old vault into properly filed, frontmatter-tagged notes in
the Hal vault. Most content is lecture notes -> **`Areas/Study/<Course>/`**; anything
clearly work/personal/health goes to the matching Area.

**Run `hal-memory import stage /path/to/OldVault` first** -- this command works on the staged
copy, never on your originals.

## Step 0 -- Locate the staging + manifest
- `STAGING = $HAL_VAULT/_Import-Staging/<name>` (`<name>` = the staged vault name the user gave, or auto-detect the
  single folder under `_Import-Staging/`).
- Read `STAGING/IMPORT-MANIFEST.md`. Note the totals and especially the **duplicate
  filenames** list -- those are the link-safety risk.
- If no manifest exists, tell the user to run `hal-memory import stage /path/to/OldVault` first
  and stop.

## Step 1 -- Propose a taxonomy mapping (confirm before moving anything)
From the manifest's top-level folders + a peek at a few notes in each, propose a table:

| Old folder | -> Destination | type | year | module |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Algorithms` | `Areas/Study/<Year>/Algorithm Design - CS2010/` | lecture | 2024-25 | CS2010 |
| `Work notes` | `Areas/Work/` | note | -- | -- |
| `Misc` | (split -- review individually) | note | -- | -- |

Rules of thumb: a folder that's clearly a course/module -> `Areas/Study/<Year>/<Module - CODE>/`
with `type: lecture` (work out the **academic year** and **module** from the path / Canvas
`Course structure.md`, never leave things in a `Linked materials` folder); work things ->
`Areas/Work/`; life/health -> `Areas/Personal` / `Areas/Health`; genuinely loose notes ->
`+Inbox/` for later triage. **Show the table and get a yes / edits before moving anything.**

## Step 2 -- Resolve filename collisions
For each duplicate filename in the manifest, propose disambiguated names (e.g.
`Intro.md` -> `Intro (Algorithms).md`). Obsidian resolves `[[links]]` by filename, so unique
names = links keep working after the move. Confirm the renames.

## Step 3 -- Process folder by folder (batched)
Do **one source folder at a time** (keeps the local model fast and lets the user sanity-check
early). For each note in the folder:
1. Read it. Derive: `year`, `course`/module, `section` (week, if a `Course structure.md` says),
   `code`, sensible `tags`, and a `date` (from a date in the note, else mtime -- `stat -c %y`).
2. Add/merge YAML frontmatter: `type` (lecture|note|exercise|...), `date`, `year`, `course`,
   `code`, `section`, `status: active`, `tags: [study, <code>, <role>]`. Don't clobber existing
   frontmatter -- merge. Add the breadcrumb line under the `# title` (see Study filing & linking
   in `CLAUDE.md`): `*[[<University>]] > [[<Year> Index]] > [[<CODE> Index]] >
   [[<CODE> Index#<Section>]]*`, where `<University>` is `$HAL_UNIVERSITY`
   (else `university` in the `[memory]` table of `~/.config/hal/config.toml`, default `University`).
3. Move the note (with any disambiguating rename) to `Areas/Study/<Year>/<Module - CODE>/`.
4. Move that note's **attachments** (images/pdfs it embeds) into the same destination so
   `![[embeds]]` keep resolving; flag any attachment-name collisions.
After each folder: report counts moved and pause briefly in case the user wants to adjust.

## Step 4 -- Link safety + topic web
If the old vault used **relative/absolute** link format (ask the user, or detect `](../`
style links via grep), rewrite those markdown links to `[[wikilinks]]` so they survive.
Pure `[[wikilink]]` / `![[embed]]` vaults need no rewriting once filenames are unique.
Also wrap genuine reusable concepts in the note bodies as `[[wikilinks]]` and create stubs in
`Areas/Study/Topics/` for any that don't exist yet, so the vault is traversable by topic.

## Step 5 -- Surface it
- Build/refresh the index spine so the graph is connected: each module's `<CODE> Index.md`
  (notes grouped by section in teaching order), each `<Year> Index.md`, and the root
  `Areas/Study/<$HAL_UNIVERSITY>.md`. The unattended runner does this automatically; when
  filing by hand, regenerate the indexes for every year/module you touched.
- Ensure `Areas/Study/_Index.md` exists (it ships with Hal). The dashboards auto-populate from
  frontmatter.

## Step 6 -- Record + clean up
- Add a line to `$HAL_VAULT/CLAUDE.md` under Current Projects / Decisions noting the import
  (source, date, courses added).
- Leave `_Import-Staging/` in place. **Only after the user confirms** everything looks right
  in Obsidian (links intact), offer to delete the staging copy.

## Step 7 -- Hand off to slides
If the import includes lecture slides (PDF, DOCX, PPTX or HTML) to summarise, tell the user to
run `hal-memory import prepare` (add `--ocr` for scanned decks), then the `summarize-slides` skill for a
few decks or `hal summarize` for many, to fill in notes for decks that don't have one yet.

Report a final summary: notes filed, courses created, collisions handled, anything skipped.
